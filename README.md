This project contains modules necessary to create the Movie Trailer page, with a list of favorite movies, descriptions, poster images and trailer URLs.
The entertainment_center.py module instantiates Movies from the media.py module, and creates a web page by passing the list of Movies to the 
open_movies_page function of the fresh_tomatoes.py module.

I'd like to acknowledge the people who taught us how to put this together and built the code for generating the page, the instructors at Udacity.
